# PostgreSQL Listen / Notify

Octavius wraps PostgreSQL's `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` in a coroutine-based API, so an application can react to database events as they happen rather than polling a table. The *cursus publicus* is not a bad mental model — Rome's state courier network: channels are the roads, notifications are the dispatches, and your listener is the officer waiting at the way-station for the next rider.

Everything lives behind `session.notifications`, an instance of `NotificationManager`.

## Subscribing and emitting

```kotlin
// Register this connection on one or more channels
session.notifications.listen("senatus_curia", "province_updates")

// Drop one subscription, or all of them
session.notifications.unlisten("senatus_curia")
session.notifications.unlistenAll()

// Dispatch a message, with or without a text payload
session.notifications.notify("province_updates", "consul_elected=42")
session.notifications.notify("province_updates")
```

Subscriptions belong to the **connection**, not to your session object: `listen` registers the physical connection behind that session. Because that connection outlives the session when it came from a pool, closing a session that subscribed to anything issues an `UNLISTEN *` on the way out — otherwise the next borrower would inherit the registrations and start receiving your notifications. Sessions that never called `listen` pay nothing for this.

What that cleanup cannot do is survive the connection itself: a dropped or replaced connection loses its subscriptions, silently and without an error, so anything long-lived has to re-subscribe after reconnecting.

Channel names are quoted as PostgreSQL identifiers, so a name with capitals or spaces survives intact and means the same thing on both `listen` and `notify`. Watch out only when something *else* emits the notification with hand-written SQL: `NOTIFY MyChannel` without quotes is folded to `mychannel` by PostgreSQL and will not reach a listener registered on `MyChannel`. Payloads are bound as parameters, never spliced into SQL.

## When a notification is actually delivered

Three rules decide whether a dispatch reaches you, and all three are PostgreSQL's:

**Only on commit.** A `notify` issued inside a transaction is held until that transaction commits. Verified: with the notifier sitting in an open transaction, the listener saw nothing; the moment the notifier committed, the message arrived. A rolled-back transaction sends nothing at all.

**Including back to the sender.** A session listening on a channel receives its own notifications too — it is not excluded.

**Payloads are limited to under 8000 bytes.** 7999 bytes go through; 8000 is refused by the server with a `DataException`. Send an identifier and let the receiver fetch the rest; a payload is a doorbell, not a delivery van. A `notify` without a payload arrives with `payload` as an empty string rather than null.

## Receiving them

Notifications surface as a `SharedFlow<PgNotification>`, collected like any other flow. Each carries the channel, the payload, and the backend process id of the sender:

```kotlin
coroutineScope.launch {
    session.notifications.messages.collect { notification ->
        println("Channel: ${notification.channel}")
        println("Payload: ${notification.payload}")
        println("Sent by backend PID: ${notification.processId}")
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> **The flow has no replay: a notification that arrives while nothing is collecting is gone.** It is not queued for a collector that shows up later. Start collecting *before* you subscribe, or at least before anything can notify the channel — otherwise the first events, which are usually the ones that matter at startup, are silently lost.

Once there *is* a collector, the buffer sized by `notificationBufferCapacity` (default **256**) absorbs bursts. When it fills, the driver discards the oldest unprocessed notification to make room for the newest — a `DROP_OLDEST` strategy, so a slow collector loses history rather than blocking the connection. The capacity is set through the connection properties or the URL (`?notificationBufferCapacity=N`).

### Notifications ride along with anything the connection reads

The driver picks up notifications while reading *any* message from the server, which has a practical consequence worth knowing: **a session that keeps running queries needs no listener loop at all.** A plain `SELECT` on the listening session delivers whatever has arrived in the meantime.

A listener loop is what you need when the connection would otherwise sit idle — nobody is reading the socket, so nothing reaches the flow.

## Listener loops

Both are suspending functions; launch one in a coroutine after subscribing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A running loop **holds the connection for its entire duration.** A query issued on that same session from another thread blocks until the loop is canceled — measured at over two seconds against a loop that was simply left running. Give a listener its own session; do not share it with query traffic.

### Polling loop

```kotlin
val job = launch { session.notifications.startPollingListenerLoop(pollTimeoutMs = 500) }
// ...
job.cancelAndJoin()
```

The sentry doing rounds: it waits on the socket with a timeout and tries again, so it can notice cancellation between attempts.

- **Graceful cancellation** — the loop simply ends, the connection stays open and in sync.
- **Reusable** — the session can go on to run queries, or return to a pool.
- **Best for** pooled or shared connections, and anywhere the connection must survive the listener.

### Interruptible loop

```kotlin
val job = launch { session.notifications.startInterruptibleListenerLoop() }
```

The sentry standing fixed watch: it blocks on the socket read indefinitely and never wakes up on its own.

- **Hard cancellation** — the blocking read cannot be interrupted politely, so cancelling forces the driver to abort the physical connection to break out of it.
- **Not reusable** — that connection is finished afterwards, by design.
- **Best for** dedicated long-lived workers, where polling is not worth paying for and throwing the connection away at shutdown costs nothing.

## Practical rules

* **Give the listener its own session.** It holds the connection while it runs, and the interruptible variant destroys it on shutdown.
* **Collect before you subscribe.** No collector means no delivery, with nothing queued and no error.
* **Treat the payload as a pointer.** Under 8000 bytes, and the receiver should fetch the real data itself — the payload cannot be trusted to carry state that matters.
* **Expect duplicates and gaps.** A dropped connection loses its subscription silently, and the buffer discards the oldest entries under load. `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` is a hint that something changed, not a durable queue.
* **Re-subscribe after reconnecting.** Subscriptions live on the connection, and a session that borrows a different physical connection is listening to nothing until it says so again.
