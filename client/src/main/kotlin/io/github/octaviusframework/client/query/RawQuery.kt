/**
 * SQL written by hand, with `@name` parameters, carrying the same terminal methods every builder carries.
 *
 * What separates it from the builders is not reach. Every clause they take is SQL and is passed through, so a
 * lateral join goes in `from`, a window function or `DISTINCT ON` in `select`, and `recursive()` is declared
 * on all four of them - there is not much they cannot say. What they do is the mechanical part: the keywords
 * and their order, the column list paired with its own placeholders, and the clauses that disappear when they
 * have nothing to say. This is for the statement you would rather write whole - one that already exists, one
 * that came from somewhere else, or one that assembling a clause at a time buys nothing.
 *
 * It is also the only query with an [execute], which is a different protocol rather than another terminal:
 * DDL, `SET` and several statements in one round trip live here because no builder can reach them.
 *
 * The SQL it was given comes back out of [toSql] like any other query's, rather than through a property of
 * its own.
