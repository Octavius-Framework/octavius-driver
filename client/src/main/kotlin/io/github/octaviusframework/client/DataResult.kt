 * The outcome of a database operation, which either carries a value or the failure that replaced it.
 *
 * Every terminal method on a client query returns one of these rather than throwing, for the class of
 * failures the database itself reports: a constraint the row violated, a deadlock, a `RAISE EXCEPTION`
 * from a routine, a statement that ran out of time. Those are conditions an application is expected to
 * have an answer for, and a return type says so where a `catch` two frames up does not.
 *
 * It does not cover every way a call can fail. A query the database refused to parse, a row that does
 * not fit the class it was asked for, a type the registry has never heard of - those are bugs in the
 * calling code, and they are thrown. [OctaviusClient] names the split exactly.
 *
