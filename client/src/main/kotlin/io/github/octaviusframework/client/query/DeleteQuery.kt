 * to mean, and a builder that lets it fall out of a `null` filter is how it happens by accident. Write it as
 * [OctaviusClient.rawQuery][io.github.octaviusframework.client.OctaviusClient.rawQuery] where it is meant.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val removed = db.deleteFrom("expired_mandates")
 *     .where("expires_at < @cutoff")
 *     .returning("id")
 *     .fetchFields<Int>("cutoff" to cutoff)
