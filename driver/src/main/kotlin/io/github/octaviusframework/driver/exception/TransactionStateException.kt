/**
 * Exception thrown when the statement itself is fine and the transaction it arrived in is not.
 *
 * The server rejects these before the statement is considered on its own merits, which is why they are not
 * [StatementException]: nothing about the SQL is wrong, and the server sends no error position to point at.
 * What is wrong is the state around it - a transaction an earlier error already doomed, one declared
 * read-only, one open where the command forbids it, or none open where the command requires one.
 *
 * `25P02` is the one worth naming twice, because it is a consequence rather than a cause: after any error
 * inside an explicit transaction PostgreSQL discards the work and rejects every further command until a
 * `ROLLBACK` arrives. The failure to read is the *first* one; this one only says the session never left it.
 *
 * The two class-25 timeouts, `25P03` and `25P04`, are not here - a transaction the server aborted on a timer
 * is [ExecutionAbortedException] with `TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT`, alongside the statement timeout it belongs with.
 *
 * @property reason The transaction state that refused the statement.
 * @property dbMessage The primary error message the server raised.
 * @property hint Explicit HINT field provided by PostgreSQL.
 * @param sqlState The SQL state code returned by the database.
 * @param serverErrorMessage The original error message from the database server.
