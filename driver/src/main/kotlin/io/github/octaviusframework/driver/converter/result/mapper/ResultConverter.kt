/**
 * Turns a decoded database value into the Kotlin type the caller asked for.
 *
 * This is the read half of the conversion SPI. By the time a converter runs, the codec has already
 * decoded the column's bytes into [S] — an `Int`, a `String`, a `PgComposite`, a `PgArray` — and the
 * converter's job is to reshape that into [T]. Register one on a session through
 * [TypeManager.registerResultConverter][io.github.octaviusframework.driver.registry.TypeManager.registerResultConverter],
 * or on a single query through
 * [registerResultConverter][io.github.octaviusframework.driver.query.OctaviusQuery.registerResultConverter].
 *
 * Converters are consulted in reverse registration order, so a later one wins over an earlier one, and
 * lookup is keyed on [supportedSourceClass]. Registering under `Any::class` opts into being asked about
 * every value, which is how the built-in reflective converters work; it also means [canConvert] has to
 * be precise, since a converter that claims a value it cannot produce raises `MappingException`
 * (`CONVERSION_ERROR`) naming the converter rather than mapping the value.
 *
 * Whether a converter may touch the session it is reading from depends on what invoked it, because that
 * decides whether the exchange with the server is still open. Under `fetchObject*`, `fetchField*` and
 * the `forEach*` family the mapping happens as rows arrive, so a converter runs *inside* an unfinished
 * exchange and issuing a query on that same session collides with it - the driver refuses the call with
 * `InvalidOperationException` (`EXECUTION_IN_PROGRESS`), surfacing as the `cause` of a
 * `MappingException` (`CONVERSION_ERROR`) carrying the path to the column. `fetchRows` and its
 * siblings hand back undecoded rows instead, so a converter reached later through `Row.get` runs after
 * the exchange has finished and is free to query. Write a converter that needs the database against a
 * second session and the distinction stops mattering.
 *
 * @param S The decoded source type this converter accepts.
 * @param T The Kotlin type it produces.
