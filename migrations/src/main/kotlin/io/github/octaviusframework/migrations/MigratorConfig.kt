/**
 * Where the migrator looks and what it accepts.
 *
 * @property sqlLocations Where the `.sql` files are. A location is either a classpath path -
 * `db/migration`, or `classpath:db/migration`, the prefix being optional because it is the usual case - or a
 * directory, `filesystem:./ops/sql`, resolved against the process's working directory. Subdirectories are
 * searched too. Empty is allowed for a project whose migrations are all Kotlin.
 * @property codePackages Packages holding [OctaviusMigration] classes, subpackages included. Empty is
 * allowed for a project whose migrations are all `.sql`; empty *along with* [sqlLocations] is not, there
 * being nothing to do.
 * @property placeholders Values pasted into `.sql` migrations before they run: `${name}` becomes the value
 * mapped to `name`. Empty - the default - and nothing is scanned for, so a migration holding a `${` of its
 * own is untouched. Once there is one, every `${name}` in every file has to have a value or the run is
 * refused; `\${name}` is that text rather than a placeholder. A paste, not a parameter: put the schema a
 * role is granted on in here, never anything that came from a user.
 * @property classLoader Where to look for classes and classpath resources, for an application whose classes
 * are not on the loader that loaded this one - an OSGi container, a plugin host. `null` uses the default.
 * @property historySchema Where the history table lives. Created if it is not there, which it has to be:
 * the table must exist before the first migration runs, so a schema a migration would have created is one
 * the history could never be kept in.
 * @property historyTable What the history table is called. Worth changing only where two applications
 * keep separate histories in one database - and then they hold separate locks too, the lock key being
 * derived from this name.
 * @property lockTimeout How long to wait for the migration lock before giving up. Waiting is the point:
 * two instances starting together is ordinary, and the one that lost the race should start a moment later
 * rather than not at all. This is what keeps waiting from meaning forever.
 * @property outOfOrder Whether to apply a migration whose version is below one already applied. Off by
 * default, because the usual cause is a branch merged late and the usual consequence is two databases
 * that ran the same migrations in different orders.
 * @property baselineVersion The version an existing database is taken to already be at, written once when
 * this migrator first meets a database with no history table. Everything at or below it is skipped rather
 * than run - which is how a database that predates the migrator gets adopted instead of rebuilt.
 * @property target The highest version to apply, or `null` for all of them. For a release that ships the
 * migrations before the code that needs them.
