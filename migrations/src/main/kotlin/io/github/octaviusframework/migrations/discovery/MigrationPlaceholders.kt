/**
 * Pastes configured values into a `.sql` migration, before anything else reads it.
 *
 * A paste and nothing more: the value goes in as the text it is, with no quoting, no escaping and no idea of
 * where in the statement it landed. That is the whole of what this does, and it is why the values belong in
 * the deployment rather than in a request - a placeholder is not a parameter, and a value that came from
 * outside the deployment would be an injection with the migrator holding the door.
 *
 * The syntax is `${name}`, and it is fixed for the same reason the `V`, `R` and `__` of the naming rule are:
 * every spelling made configurable is API to keep working, and none of them would make a migration read
 * better. `\${name}` is that text and not a placeholder, for the file that has to store one.
 *
 * Substitution happens **before** the header directives are read and before the transaction-control check
 * runs, so what those checks see is what the server will see - a value carrying a `COMMIT` is refused rather
 * than smuggled past them. It happens in one pass, so a value that itself contains `${...}` is left standing
 * as the text it is: one file, one round of substitution, and no value can reach back for another.
