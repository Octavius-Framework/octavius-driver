 * A migration's version, ordered the way version numbers are ordered rather than the way text is.
 *
 * `1.9` comes before `1.10`, which is the whole reason this is a type and not a `String`. Parts are held as
 * `Long`, so a version written as a timestamp - `20260827120000`, a convention plenty of projects use -
 * counts as a number rather than overflowing into nonsense.
 *
 * **Missing parts are zero, so `1`, `1.0` and `1.0.0` are one version, not three.** They compare equal, they
 * hash alike, and two migrations carrying them are a duplicate rather than a sequence. [text] keeps whichever
 * of them was actually written; [canonical] is the spelling that goes into the history table.

     * is settled by their parts, never by this string.
