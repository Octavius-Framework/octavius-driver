/**
 * A migration written in Kotlin rather than in `.sql`.
 *
 * **Its version and description come from the class name**, exactly as a file's do: `V2__Add_indexes` is
 * version 2, `V2_1__Add_indexes` is version 2.1 - a class name cannot hold a `.`, so `_` separates the parts
 * there - and `R__Rebuild_views` is repeatable. Nothing on this interface says which migration it is, and
 * that is the point: the scan reads the name and never constructs the class, so a migration that ran months
 * ago runs none of your code at startup.
 *
 * The class needs a constructor that takes no arguments, and is built once, immediately before it runs, then
 * dropped. It is not a bean and holding one would buy nothing.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class V3__Backfill_provinces : OctaviusMigration {
 *     override fun migrate(session: OctaviusSessionOperations) {
 *         session.createNativeQuery("UPDATE provinces SET tribute = 0 WHERE tribute IS NULL").update()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

     * it has no checksum for.
